    <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book.</p>
    <p>Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

            <p>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.</p>
            <p>Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</p>
